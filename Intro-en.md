# Instruction

# **Task**



### Your task is to annotate all privacy-threatening content in given images (Normally there are 10 images).  Please first input your basic information and fill out a small questionnaire.  After you click the bottommost button, you will go to the annotation interface.



# **How to use the interface**



### Click the button '**Loading the next image**' to get the next image you need to annotate.  You will see a list of labels after you load an image.  You need to click each of them to answer if you regard this content as **privacy-threatening**.  If you think this content is privacy-threatening, please ask the questions folded in the label.  If you think this content is not privacy-threatening, please check the 'not privacy' box to **skip the annotation**.  You may add extra bounding boxes by the button 'Create bounding box' if you find something privacy-threatening but **does not be given in the default bounding boxes**.  After you click it, please move your mouse to the image and create a bounding box by mouse down and mouse up.  Please also tell us why you create extra bounding boxes.  Once you finish all the annotations, please click '**Loading the next image**' to annotate the next image.  



# **How to know if I finish the task?**



### If you finish all the annotation tasks, the interface will pop up a piece of information.  Then, you may leave the interface and get approved on the platform.  If you want to leave the interface before finishing all tasks, please input the same info (especially **Worker's ID**) on this page and you may resume your task stage.



# PS (Only Japanese version has)

### Because of issues with data format, labels of objects are given in English. If you find it difficult to understand what is shown in the bounding box, please go to https://www.deepl.com/translator and input the label to get its meaning. 

### Sorry for the inconvenience.
