  ## Metrics

  ### **Information Type**

  **Description**: 

  English: Assuming you want to seek privacy of the photo owner, what kind of information can this content tell?

  Japanese: 写真の所有者のプライバシーを得ようとする場合、このコンテンツからはどのような情報を読み取れますか？

  **Difference**: personal identity-> personal information; personal habits -> Individual preferences/pastimes; add 'other's secret/private information' 

  **Justification**: ANOVA test on DIPA 1.0 revealed that "Information Type" can be significantly related to the "category" of visual content (F(21, 3148)=66.4, p<0.01, effect size = .307). Providing "Information Type", therefore, assisting researchers to build button-up understandings from various privacy-threatening content to essential types of privacy. Moreover, when expanding categories of privacy-threatening content, "Information Type"  enable researchers to establish explainable reasoning to decide if content can be privacy-threatening.

  While DIPA 1.0 provides a plausible taxonomy of what types of information can privacy-threatening contents tell heuristically, we modified and expanded options for this metric by analyzing participants' free-form answers in DIPA 1.0.  Participants were provided with five default options of “personal information”, “location of shooting”, “individual preferences/pastimes”, “social circle”, and others' private/confidential information as well as a free-form textbox.

  **Option choices:**

  - personal information 

  - location of shooting

  - individual preferences/pastimes (個人の興味・関心・趣味・生活スタイル)

  - social circle　

  - others' private/confidential information (他人(組織)の情報)

  - other things

    

  ### **Informativeness of the privacy-threatening content**

  **Description**: 

  English: How informative do you think about this privacy information to identify the above thing you selected? More stars mean the more informative the content is (Please click the star to input your answer).

  Japanese: あなたが選択した上記の情報を認識するために、どの程度役立つと思われますか？星が多いほど、情報量が多いことを意味します（星をクリックして答えをご入力ください）。

  **Difference**: Scale 1 ~ 7 -> Star 1 ~ 5

  Using descriptive statement to avoid personal biases when selecting scores. 

  **Justification**: DIPA 1.0 successfully rated privacy-threatening contents by the perceived degree of severity of privacy threats. Our ANOVA test showed that 'informativeness' had a significant effect on **maximum sharing scope** (F(6, 3020)=91.84, p<0.01, effect size = .154). However, in our inference tests, we found it difficult to distinguish adjacent values of "informativeness". This indicated that fewer options and more understandable statements should be used in future data collection processes. We then change the 7-Likert scale to a 5-Likert scale and provide detailed instructions for better value-threat level references.

  **Option choices:**

  - It is a negligible source to identify {Information Type} (1 Star) 
  - It is a minor source to identify {Information Type} (2 Stars) 
  - It is a moderate source to identify {Information Type} (3 Stars) 
  - It is an effective source to identify {Information ype} (4 Stars)
  - It is a substantial source to identify {Information Type} (5 Stars)

  - {Information Type}を特定するための、ほとんど役に立たない情報源です（星1つ）
  - {Information Type}を特定するための、軽微な情報源です（星2つ）
  - {Information Type}を特定するための、中程度の情報源です（星3つ）
  - {Information Type}を特定するための、有効な情報源です（星4つ）
  - {Information Type}を特定するための、多大な情報源です（星5つ）

  ### **Sharing scopes if you are the photo owner** 

  **Description**: 

  English: Assuming you are the photo owner, who would you like to share this content to (Please select all possible groups)? 

  Japanese: あなたが写真の所有者であると仮定して、このコンテンツを誰にシェアしたいですか（可能なすべてのグループを選択してください）？

  **Difference**: Family or friends -> Close relationship (親密な関係); Normal relationship (普通の関係); Unfamiliar people (見慣れない人)

  Avoiding different perspectives on specific groups

  **Justification**: Besides the ANOVA test that revealed a significant relationship between "informative" and "maximum sharing scopes",  we found "bigfives" personality performed significant roles when inferring "maximum sharing scopes". It is promising to remain this metric for understanding the interaction among personality, visual information and willingness to share. 

  DIPA 1.0 followed a typical option design with various recipient groups as well as previous studies did (e.g. Colleagues & Classmates, supervisors, normal friends, and relatives). We argue that different people may hold different opinions when we tell them about a specific group of recipients. For example, for family or colleagues, somebody might think it can be a close relationship while others possibly want to avoid showing information to them in some situations. Sometimes, people do not want to share photos of their close relationships but choose to share them with strangers. Therefore, it is not objective to use a specific group to refer to different scales of sharing or assume that if people want to share a photo with the public, they just want to share it to closer relationships. We decided to change this question to a multiple-choice form and replaced specific groups (i.e. family or friend) of recipients with more general descriptions (i.e. close relationship, regular relationship, acquaintances).

  **Option choices (Multiple choices):**

  - I won't share it. 
  - Close relationship (親密な関係)
  - Regular relationship (通常の関係)
  - Acquaintances (知人)
  - Public 
  - Broadcast program
  - Others

  

  ### **[New] Sharing scopes if someone what to share this photo when it is related to you**

  **Description**: 

  English: If the privacy-threatening content is related to you and someone else wants to share this content, to what extent would you allow the person to share this content to their relationship? 

  Japanese: プライバシーを脅かす内容が自分に関係する場合、他の人がこのコンテンツを共有したいと考えた場合、あなたはその人がこのコンテンツをその人の関係者に共有することをどの程度まで許容しますか？

  **Justification**: Researchers have increased interest in investigating photo privacy conflicts [1]. Collecting people's attitudes on allowing others to share their privacy enables researchers to analyze the paradigm of managing co-own photos. We asked participants to answer whether they allow others to share and to what extent they allow others to share if they were the photo owner. The option design is the same as the previous metric.

  - I won't allow others to share it. (共有することは認めない)
  - Close relationship (親密な関係)
  - Regular relationship (通常の関係)
  - Acquaintances (知人)

  - Broadcast program
  - Others

  

  

  ### [Abandoned design]**Sharing scopes if this photo is owned by others**
