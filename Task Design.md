## Discussion

**Existing metrics**:

- **Reason for identifying content as privacy-threatening**

  - Other papers concluded that reasons like "photo quality" and "illegal" as the reason to identify a photo to be sensitive. However, I do not want to add these options as they are subjective. "Personal habits" can include those things. Or we can say "personal habits/life". I wonder if you have a better idea to rename this option. I think others are fine.

- **Informativeness of the privacy-threatening content**

  - Using "uninformative" to describe how much information a privacy-threatening content might be not suitable. I change the description to only mention this metric as "informative" and how informative it is. As adverbs (e.g. slightly, little, moderate)  can be implied differently by different people, I choose to use rating scores in the next data collection. Also, changing 7-Likert to 5-Likert can avoid ambiguity in near scores (e.g. find it difficult to choose 3 or 4).

- **Maximum sharing scope if you are the photo owner** 

  - Many other papers use different recipient groups (e.g. Colleagues & Classmates, supervisors, normal friends, and relatives). It is not practical to include all possible groups in our data collection. Also, different people may hold different opinions when we tell them about a specific group of recipients. For example, saying family or colleagues, somebody might think it can be a close relationship while others just want to avoid showing information to them. So, actually, it is not objective when we use a specific group to refer to different scales of sharing. I do not have a concrete idea to solve this problem. But I think we need to clearly show that the scale of provided choices is a recursive increase.

    

**New possible metrics**:

- â€‹	**If the privacy-threatening content is related to you and someone else wants to share this image, to what extent would you share this content at most?**
  - I won't share it
  - Family or friend
  - Public
  - Broadcast program
  - Others

This can be useful when we analyze "bystander sharing" (i.e. sharing photos without getting approvals from stakeholders) behavior.
